CFG testing
Please select one of the below files from the path '../tests/CFG_tests' in order to execute the test case.

1. Incorrect cases.
Test2
Production rule contains non-terminal symbol which is not defined.

Expected output:
The program should raise an error with the message "Invalid CFG".

Test3
Left recursion.

Expected output:
The program should raise an error with the message "Left recursion is not supported!".

Test4
Production rules defined by a terminal symbol.

Expected output:
The program should raise an error with the message "Production rules must start with non-terminal symbols.".

Test5
Duplicated non-terminal symbols.
Expected output:
The program should raise an error with the message "Non-terminal symbol {} already exists in CFG!".


Test6
CFG provided in a file with different extention than .txt
Expected output:
The program should raise an error with the message "CFG file must be in .txt format.".


2. Correct cases.
Test6
Non-terminal symbol never used.
Expected output:
The program should properly parse the provided CFG and then ask for the input string.

Test
Correct CFG.
Expected output:
The program should properly parse the provided CFG and then ask for the input string.

Input string testing
In order to execute test cases there is a need to provide a correct CFG first. Please take any .txt from the path '../tests/correct_CFG' and ten type input string.

Test
Input as an empty string.
Expected output:
The program should raise an error with the message "Invalid input string".

Test
Input string not ending with '$' symbol.
Expected output:
The program should raise an error with the message "Invalid input string".

Parsing testing

1. Accepted input strings.

Test
Please select CFG: '../tests/correct_CFG/test1.txt'

Input:

Expected output:


Test Simple one-level backtracking.
Please select CFG: '../tests/correct_CFG/test1.txt'


Test More complex backtracking cases.
Please select CFG: '../tests/correct_CFG/test1.txt'


2. Not accepted input strings.
