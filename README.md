# Top down parser with backtracking.

## Build&run  
The program requires python3.   
Go to source directory and execute: 
```sh
python3 main.py
```

## Description
The program asks for CFG file. After valid CFG is provided, the program asks for input string.  
After validation is successful the input is parsed. At each parsing stage the current parsing tree is printed to the terminal.  
When parsing is finished there is printed information about input string being accepted by the provided CFG and final parsing tree.
